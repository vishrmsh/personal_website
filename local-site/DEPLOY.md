# Deploy Your Independent Website

## Quick Deployment to GitHub Pages

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to GitHub.com and create a new repository
2. Name it: `vishrmsh.github.io` (or any name for project pages)
3. Make it public

### Step 2: Upload Files
Upload these files to your repository:
- `index.html` (your complete website)
- `CNAME` (for custom domain)

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to repository Settings
2. Scroll to "Pages" section
3. Select "Deploy from a branch"
4. Choose "main branch"
5. Save

### Step 4: Configure Your Domains

#### For vishrmsh.com (currently on Wix):
1. Log into Wix dashboard
2. Go to Domain settings
3. Change DNS records to:
   ```
   A Record: @ → 185.199.108.153
   A Record: @ → 185.199.109.153
   A Record: @ → 185.199.110.153
   A Record: @ → 185.199.111.153
   CNAME: www → yourusername.github.io
   ```

#### For vishramesh.com (GoDaddy):
1. Log into GoDaddy
2. Go to DNS Management
3. Add the same A and CNAME records as above

### Step 5: Test
- Your site will be live at: `https://yourusername.github.io`
- Both domains will redirect to the same site
- GitHub provides free SSL certificates

## Alternative: Netlify Deployment

### Quick Netlify Setup:
1. Go to netlify.com
2. Drag and drop your `local-site` folder
3. Site goes live instantly
4. Add custom domains in site settings
5. Point both domains to Netlify's name servers

## Benefits of Moving Off Wix:
✅ **Full Control**: No platform restrictions
✅ **Better Performance**: Faster loading
✅ **No Monthly Fees**: Free hosting options
✅ **Custom Code**: Add any functionality
✅ **Better SEO**: Clean, fast code
✅ **Version Control**: Track all changes
✅ **Multiple Domains**: Easy to manage both domains

## Cost Comparison:
- **Current**: Wix hosting fees + domain fees
- **New**: $0/month (free hosting) + domain fees only

## Next Steps:
1. Test your local site: `cd local-site && python3 start-local-server.py`
2. Choose hosting platform (GitHub Pages recommended)
3. Upload files
4. Update DNS for both domains
5. Cancel Wix hosting (keep domain if needed)
